            <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place butter in the bottom of a 9x13 baking dish and place in the oven to melt.</li>
                <li>When butter is melted, add chicken in a single layer over the butter. Top evenly with frozen veggies. </li>
                <li>Stir together biscuit mix, seasoning packet from the mix, and milk in a bowl until well blended; pour over the chicken and veggies. Spread lightly and evenly over the top of the  mixture but do not stir.</li>
                <li>Whisk together soup and stock in a second bowl until smooth. Pour over biscuit mix but do not stir.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven uncovered until very golden brown and only very slightly jiggly in the center, about 45 minutes.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle parsley over the top if desired and let stand for 10 minutes before serving. </li>
            </ol>
